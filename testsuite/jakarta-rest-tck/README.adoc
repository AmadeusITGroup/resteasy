= RESTEasy Jakarta RESTful Web Services TCK

This module will run RESTEasy in https://wildfly.org[WildFly] against the
https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/[Jakarta REST] TCK.

== Executing the test

IMPORTANT: Current you *MUST* build from the `testsuite` directory as there is no `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta-restful-ws-tck`
in a public Maven repository. You must also activate the `jakarta-rest-tck` profile with either `-Pjakarta-rest-tck` or
`-Djakarta.rest.tck`.

=== Executing tests

----
mvn clean verify -Djakarta.rest.tck
----

=== Executing tests from the `jakarta-rest-tck`

To execute the tests  you can simply run:

----
mvn clean verify
----

You can turn on trace logging for the TCK with the `-Dtck.log.trace=true` system property.

----
mvn clean verify -Dtck.log.trace=true
----

To run an individual test you can use the failsafe plugin property `-Dit.test=YourTestIT`.

----
mvn clean verify -Dit.test=UriBuilderIT
